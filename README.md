# jython-2.5-backports
Backported libraries for use in Ignition's Jython 2.5 environment

To use simply copy the contents of the `pylib` folder to your Ignition's installation under `./user-lib./pylib`. 
For example, by default this will be
`C:\Program Files\Inductive Automation\Ignition\user-lib\pylib`
